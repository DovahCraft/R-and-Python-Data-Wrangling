# R and Python Data Wrangling

Home of my Fall 2020 Honors project. Goal is to learn about key data science tools and compare and contrast the two key languages for it: R and Python. 

<h2>Key differences between R and Python</h2>

<h3>R</h3>
+ ggplot2 is a good plotting library for R. <br>
+ Importing datasets from a package and from a url.
+ Rmd files instead of Jupyter


<h3>Python</h3>
+ Pandas is a huge component of Python Data Wrangling. Encompasses the data frame and csv reading for example. <br>
+ No really good ggplot equivalent in Python. The libraries that are available feel like R anyway if they try to emulate ggplot2. <br> 
+ Jupyter Notebook (formally/now encompasses IPython Notebooks)
+ I use anaconda, which comes with a Python installation and a "in my opinion" better pip command, the conda command. 

<h2> Notes/Comments on Exercises </h2>

**Module 1 (8/17/2020)**

Using Anaconda, installation video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk

Jupytr Notebook contains IPython Notebooks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk

  - Navigate to git repo in powershell
  - Type command: jupyter notebook
  - Redirect to localhosted jupyter repo.
 
 
Pandas and file reading: https://realpython.com/pandas-python-explore-dataset/
 
Export to pdf works badly in Jupyter's gui, trying on the command line. 
Command line worked perfectly using:

**jupyter nbconvert Chp1Exercises.ipynb --to pdf**

**Module 2 (8/17/2020)**
