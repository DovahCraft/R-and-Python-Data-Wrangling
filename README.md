# R and Python Data Wrangling

Fall 2020 Honor's Project Home. Goal is to learn about key data science tools and compare and contrast the two key languages for it: R and Python. 

**Exercise 1 (8/17/2020)**

Using Anaconda, installation video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk

Jupytr Notebook contains IPython Notebooks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk

  - Navigate to git repo in powershell
  - Type command: jupyter notebook
  - Redirect to localhosted jupyter repo.
 
 
Pandas and file reading: https://realpython.com/pandas-python-explore-dataset/
 
Export to pdf works badly in Jupyter's gui, trying on the command line. 
Command line worked perfectly using:

**jupyter nbconvert Chp1Exercises.ipynb --to pdf**
